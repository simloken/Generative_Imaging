## Directory Structure

---

### Code/
Contains all the source code for the project, including the main training and generation scripts. It also includes a `/tools/` subfolder for utility modules and helper functions.

- `main.py`: Entry point for training and generating data.
- `runner.py`: Orchestrates generative method modules.
- The different generative methods: `GAN.py`, `VAE.py`, `RBM.py`, `DDPM.py`
- `tools/`: Helper functions and utilities shared across modules.

### Data/
Holds data used by the project.

- `classifier.pth`: A pre-trained MNIST classifier used for evaluating generated outputs. A new classifier will be generated by `classify.py` if missing.
- After running `main.py`, this folder will be populated with a training and test dataset, respectively.

### Figures/
Collection of visual results, including:

- Plots and images used in the final paper.
- Diagnostic/debugging figures.
- GIFs showing the progression of training or generation.

### Paper/
All publication-related files:
